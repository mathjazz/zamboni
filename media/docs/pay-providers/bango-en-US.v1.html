<p>A. BANGO will only make available Content through the BANGO System if You and Your Content meet the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>(1)  Your Content must meet the requirements set out in the Firefox Marketplace guidelines, as amended from time to time, a copy of which may be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Publishing/Marketplace_review_criteria.  If any of Your Content does not meet the Firefox Marketplace guidelines, BANGO may, at its sole discretion, elect not to offer that Content, or cease sales of copies that Content, through the BANGO System.</p>
<p>(2)  The information You provide to BANGO through the Developer Portal shall be accurate and truthful, and You shall immediately update such information through the Developer Portal in the event any such information changes.</p>
<p>(3)  End Users must place orders themselves through the BANGO System.  You are not permitted to place orders on behalf of End Users, nor to authorize anyone to place orders on an End User's behalf.</p>
<p>(4)  You will provide BANGO with all necessary product information through the Developer Portal so that End Users do not need to contact You for additional information prior to a sale by BANGO of Content.</p>
<p>(5)  You shall provide a Suggested Retail Price through the Developer Portal for each item of Content which You wish to make available through the BANGO System.  The Suggested Retail Price must be provided to BANGO in the currencies and in the manner indicated in the Developer Portal.  For the avoidance of doubt, while You may provide Suggested Retail Prices for copies of Your Content, BANGO is solely responsible for setting the price at which copies of Your Content will be sold by BANGO through the BANGO System, which may reflect Your Suggested Retail Price at BANGO's sole discretion.</p>
<p>(6)  You will not submit through the Developer Portal any products other than Content (such as but not limited to products which are fulfilled physically), unless otherwise agreed to in writing by You and BANGO.</p>
<p>If BANGO determines at any time that You or any of Your Content does not meet or follow any of the provisions of this Agreement, or of any agreement between You and Mozilla relating to Firefox Marketplace, or that You are otherwise in breach of any provision of this Agreement, BANGO may, at its sole option, immediately suspend selling Your Content until such noncompliance and/or breach is remedied, and/or terminate this Agreement for uncured breach in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<h4>3.      GENERAL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT</h4>

<p>A.  Submitting Content; Approval Process.  You will submit to BANGO, through the Developer Portal, Content You would like BANGO to make available through the BANGO System, together with such information as is requested by BANGO, or on BANGO's behalf by Mozilla.  Your submission of Content through the Developer Portal constitutes Your request for BANGO to sell such Content through the BANGO System.  Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute BANGO's commitment or obligation to sell copies of Your Content. You further acknowledge and agree that BANGO may, at any time, in BANGO's sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, remove, or have removed, Content from an End User’s wireless handheld device and Firefox Marketplace purchased content locker.</p>
<p>B.  Legal Relationship; Sales of Copies of Your Content. You hereby grant to BANGO, the right to make copies of Your Content free of charge for its own internal use and testing purposes. When an order for Content is placed through the BANGO System by an End User, BANGO shall purchase from You and resell to that End User such Content along with the right to use the Content.  BANGO and/or Mozilla shall have full control over the design, operation, features and functionality and End User terms and policies applicable to the Firefox Marketplace and BANGO System.  Title to Content sold through the BANGO System to an End User shall pass from BANGO to that End User upon the completion of both:  (a) BANGO's receipt of payment for that Content; (b) the provision to the End User of access to download the Content.</p>
<p>C.  Your EULA.   You shall provide an EULA under which You wish to license Your Content for the particular jurisdictions in which the Content is to be made available.  This EULA shall at minimum, include provisions excluding BANGO (not necessarily by name, but at least by role, e.g. channel partners and associated Service Providers) from any liability whatsoever in relation to Your Content.  You agree and acknowledge that any EULA You enter into with an End User is an agreement between You and the End User, and BANGO shall not be a party to that EULA.</p>
<p>D.  End User Data.  Because BANGO is the reseller to End Users of Your Content, BANGO is the party with whom the End User is transacting business for each Transaction.  As such, the End User is giving his/her/its End User Data to BANGO.  You agree that End User Data obtained in connection with a Transaction shall not be owned by You, and You shall not have any rights to such End User Data.    Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict You from using for Your lawful business purposes any data provided to You directly by an End User in connection with that End User's registration or use of Content.</p>
<p>E.  Support.  You are solely responsible for, and agree to provide, reasonable operational and technical support and assistance to End Users in connection with their installation/un-installation, use, and operation of Your Content made available through the BANGO System along with a warranty for Your Content which is at a minimum consistent with the requirements of the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  You must provide to BANGO, by means of the Developer Portal, an email address for technical and operational support.  Please note that neither BANGO nor Mozilla will provide software help-desk or other forms of technical support concerning Your Content. BANGO's support (which may be provided by Mozilla on BANGO's behalf) is limited to assistance to End Users with the use of the BANGO System.</p>
<p>F.  BANGO's Trademarks; Publicity.  BANGO's trademarks, service marks and business names (BANGO's "Trademarks") are owned or licensed solely and exclusively by BANGO. You may only make any press release regarding this Agreement which includes BANGO's name, logo, or otherwise refers to BANGO, with prior written consent from BANGO to do so.</p>

<h4>4.  PAYMENTS AND RETURNS</h4>
<p>A.  Sale of Content. For each item of content that BANGO sells to an End User, BANGO will purchase that copy from You for the BANGO Purchase Price.  BANGO shall not be liable to pay any additional licensing or usage fees to You or to any third party.  All amounts which BANGO owes You for the sale of Your Content shall be placed in a general in-house account maintained by BANGO and BANGO will pay You from that account as described below.  You will not be entitled to interest on amounts held in BANGO's general in-house account while such amounts are in BANGO's possession.</p>
<p>B.  Taxes.</p>
<p>(1) Sales Tax, VAT or other Business to Business Taxes.  If there are any taxes ("B2B Taxes") which You are required to collect from BANGO on Your sale of  Content to BANGO, You will be solely responsible for the payment of any and all such applicable B2B Taxes (or Your income derived therefrom) from the BANGO Purchase Price amounts paid to You by BANGO. You agree that You shall not have any right to separately invoice BANGO for B2B Taxes on Your sale of Content to BANGO, except that where law requires a separate invoice of any B2B Taxes, you shall have the right to send any such invoices to BANGO, marked "paid" as BANGO's payment of any amounts in such invoice(s) shall be considered already paid as part of the BANGO Purchase Price due to You from BANGO.</p>
<p>(2) Withholding Tax. In the event BANGO determines that withholding taxes are applicable to any payments due to You from BANGO, You agree and acknowledge that such payments by BANGO shall be net of any applicable withholding taxes.  You shall provide to BANGO all data reasonably necessary for BANGO to support any B2B Taxes included in the purchase price of Content. You shall be solely responsible for, and shall hold BANGO harmless from and against, the calculation of B2B Taxes due from BANGO on Your sale of  Content to BANGO, and any failure to collect B2B Taxes from BANGO on Your sale of Content to BANGO at the time of sale to BANGO and any claims, causes of action, costs (including, for example, reasonable attorney's fees) and any other liabilities of any nature whatsoever related to those taxes (including without limitation interest and penalties that result from any failure).</p>
<p>(3) VAT.  If You are registered for VAT in the United Kingdom, You will need to provide to BANGO or to Mozilla, at BANGO's request, Your VAT number. If Your VAT status should change, or You sell all or part of your business, You must notify Bango in writing, immediately.</p>

<p>C.  Returns and Refunds.  BANGO, as the seller and merchant of record for the BANGO System, is responsible for setting and applying the returns policy applicable to the BANGO System.</p>
<p>If BANGO, at its option, provides a right of return for Content made available through the BANGO System, and BANGO accepts the return of Content in accordance with such right of return, You shall also accept the return of that particular item of Content, and shall refund the amount paid to You by BANGO in relation to that Content by way of BANGO setting off this amount against other monies otherwise owing to You.  You further agree and acknowledge that BANGO will treat any non-fraudulent Chargeback or other non-fraudulent End User-, bank- or payment provider-initiated reversal of a previously completed payment as a validly accepted return and a refund validly provided by BANGO.</p>
<p>D.  Chargebacks, Fraud and Suppressed Orders.  A "Chargeback" is another form of refund that happens when a payment provider such as a mobile network operator (wireless carrier), a credit card processor, or acquiring bank unilaterally revokes a prior transaction, which may be done under the scheme rules of the mobile network operator, the credit card banking system for such reasons as fraud or suspected fraud, End User complaint, or other reasons determined at the sole discretion of the mobile network operator, the credit card processors and/or banks. BANGO makes no promises to You as to whether or how the mobile network operator, credit card processors and/or banks will interpret their rules or rights concerning Chargebacks. You acknowledge that mobile network operator and credit and debit card transactions through the BANGO System may be subject to a higher level of Chargeback activity compared to physical credit card Transactions with chip and PIN confirmation or wet-ink signatures.</p>
<p>For each Chargeback or other payment reversal in relation to  Your Content sold through the BANGO System, You agree to allow BANGO to offset the amount of such Chargebacks and payment reversals against amounts due to You from BANGO, or invoice You for such amounts if BANGO is unable to offset such amounts. Further, any sale of Content where the fulfillment of that Content has been made on behalf of BANGO upon receipt of a valid payment authorization but is subsequently rejected, cancelled or uncollectible from an end user prior to settlement by BANGO, will not be treated as a completed sale to an End User by BANGO for the purposes of calculating payments due to You.  This paragraph shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.</p>
<p>E.  Payment Method and Frequency.  To provide a standardized, efficient and timely settlement process, BANGO requires You to agree to a Self-Billing Invoice ("SBI") system. The self-billing invoice is a standardized document that Bango produces each month on Your behalf, which You accept and agree to as the sole invoice document for settlement under this Agreement. This invoice relieves You of any requirement to produce Your own invoice in order to receive payments. This agreement to self-billing invoicing automatically renews every 12 months, unless You notify us in writing of Your intention to withdraw from the system.  Within five (5) working days of the end of each calendar month BANGO will make available to You through the Developer Portal an indicative report (“Indicative Earnings Report”) of accrued BANGO Purchase Price amounts on sales of copies of Your Content, net of returns, chargebacks, applicable withholding taxes, and other amounts due to BANGO under this Agreement (“Indicative Earnings”).  In the month following the month in which the Indicative Earnings Report is produced BANGO shall raise on Your behalf a SBI.  SBIs shall confirm those amounts payable to You (“Due Amounts”) and BANGO shall pay You on the first working day of the next calendar month. You acknowledge that BANGO may split payment of a Due Amount into multiple contemporaneous payments based on the payment provider's requirements.</p>
<p>Payments shall be made to You via electronic bank transfer or other means as determined by BANGO.  BANGO's payment obligations to You are subject to the following:</p>
<p>(1)  BANGO may determine to hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if BANGO has a reasonable basis to believe that it will likely be necessary to cover future refunds, charges against Your account, or other liabilities You may owe to BANGO. BANGO may also hold back all or a portion of Your Due Amounts if BANGO reasonably believes that the funds represent fraudulent transactions or involve other kinds of illegal activities or represent erroneous transactions. BANGO's statements or other communication from BANGO will note how much BANGO is holding back. BANGO will keep any held back amounts only for a reasonable time as determined in BANGO's sole discretion, and will promptly pay to You any remaining held back amounts after that reasonable time has passed. Regardless of any hold back BANGO may choose to keep, You agree to pay BANGO, upon demand, for any shortfall owed to BANGO due to refunds, Chargebacks, fraud, suppressed orders, or other fees for services rendered if they cannot be offset from Your account within ninety (90) calendar days  of the date BANGO first seeks to offset such charges. If BANGO actually keeps (or sets off) any of the funds BANGO has held back against amounts due to You, BANGO will do so in a manner that BANGO believes fairly reflects Your liability owed to BANGO, and BANGO will note the set-off and provide You with an explanation of the set-off. BANGO shall be entitled to set off, against any holdback funds, any amount needed to reimburse BANGO for BANGO's costs or expenses of defending against any claims against BANGO related to Your breach of this Agreement, including an amount to pay any attorneys' fees BANGO incurs associated with any such claims.</p>
<p>(2)  Any and all amounts payable to You under this Agreement shall be paid to You in the currency you select in the Developer Portal ("Package Currency").  Please note that, in circumstances where Transactions are processed in a currency other than Your Package Currency, Due Amounts may vary from Indicative Earnings due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the date BANGO raises its report setting out Indicative Earnings and the date of production by BANGO of the SBI.</p>
<p>(3)  You may not request that BANGO make payments of Due Amounts to a third party on Your behalf.</p>
<p>(4)  If You do not object in writing to amounts retained by BANGO within thirty (30) calendar days of a given payment of a Due Amount from which such amounts are retained, or to an invoiced amount by the payment due date specified on the invoice, You shall be deemed to have acknowledged the correctness of that invoice or amount and to have waived its right to dispute that invoice or amount.</p>
<p>(5) BANGO may withhold payment of the relevant part of a Due Amount until the payment is received from the payment provider.</p>
<p>(6) BANGO may withhold payments of Due Amounts if the amount due to You is less than $50 (US Dollars) or £50 (UK pounds sterling) or €50 (Euros),  in any settlement period, until the amount due exceeds this sum.</p>

<h4>5.      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS</h4>
<p>A.  Mutual.  You and BANGO each make the following representations, warranties and covenants to the other:</p>
<p>(1)  Each party has full right, power and authority to enter into and fully perform its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation the right to bind any party it purports to bind to this Agreement.</p>

<p>(4)  You will not engage in deceptive trade practices, or directly solicit End Users or potential End Users who have not affirmatively consented to receive direct solicitations from You, or otherwise violate any laws, rules or regulations applicable to the sale of Your Content through the BANGO System to End Users on Authorized Networks and the conduct of Your business.</p>
<p>(5)  You will not use commercial e-mail (solicited or unsolicited) to market Your Content if that use of commercial e-mail violates any applicable laws or regulations regarding the use of commercial e-mail. You will comply with any legal obligations to provide proper labeling and content within Your marketing e-mails, and to provide opt-in or opt-out capabilities to recipients and comply with any such requests.</p>

<h4>7.  TERM AND TERMINATION</h4>
<p>A. Term.  This Agreement starts on the date BANGO acknowledges its acceptance of this Agreement as set forth herein, and will last until either You or BANGO terminates this Agreement as set forth herein.  Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause by providing the other party with no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior notice in writing of the terminating party's decision to terminate.   In the event You are (in BANGO's sole opinion) in material breach or commit a series of breaches amounting to a material breach of this Agreement or have failed to perform any of Your material obligations under this Agreement, and have not cured such breach or failure within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified by BANGO of such breach or failure, BANGO may terminate this Agreement on notice to You without further opportunity to cure.  Further, BANGO may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by delivering to You notice of its decision to do so, if: (a) BANGO ceases to operate the BANGO System in connection with Firefox Marketplace; (b) BANGO is required to do so by law; (c) You are not in good standing with BANGO or Mozilla (other than due to a breach of this Agreement in which case the cure period set forth above shall apply).</p>
<p>B.  Termination.  Upon termination of this Agreement:  (a) You will immediately cease any use of BANGO's name, logos or Trademarks, and remove any approved hyperlinks to the BANGO System that deal with the sale of copies of Your Content; (b) BANGO will promptly halt any sale of copies of Your Content through the BANGO System; (c) BANGO will continue to make payments to You of amounts due to You under this Agreement, on the regular pay cycle dates, until the time that Your account has reached a zero balance (BANGO's hold back rights as described in Section 4(E)(1) above, and Your obligation to pay BANGO for any shortfall in Your account, shall survive the termination of the Agreement); and (d) You will continue to be responsible for any liability that might arise out of Chargebacks, any infringement of intellectual property rights, any violation of laws, rules or regulations that may have occurred as a result of copies of Your Content being made available via the BANGO System, and any breach by You of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>C.  Survival.  The provisions of this Agreement which, by their terms, require performance after the termination of this Agreement, or have application to events that may occur after the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement, which provisions shall include without limitation sections 1, 2, 3(A), 3(D), 3(E), 3(F), 4, 5, 6, 7(B), 7(C), and 8.</p>

<h4>8.  MISCELLANEOUS</h4>
<p>A.  Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed in writing, these terms and conditions form the entire agreement between Bango and you, and supersede any prior agreement covering the same subject matter and any prior written or oral representations.</p>
<p>B.  Changes to this Agreement. These terms and conditions are subject to change.  In the event that any revisions are material in nature, BANGO will provide You with notice by posting the revised version of the Agreement on the Developer Portal after which the new ones will apply. Should you not accept the new terms and conditions, you may terminate this agreement, in which case the notice period and Termination provisions in this agreement will not apply.</p>
<p>C.  Relationship of the Parties. You and BANGO are independent contractors of, and not an employee, agent or authorized representative of, the other.  Neither party shall have the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of each other nor to make any representations or warranties to third parties on behalf of the other party.  Mozilla and its affiliates shall be considered third party beneficiaries of sections 3(A), 3(C), 3(D), and 6 of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce these sections with respect to Mozilla and its affiliates only. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under this Agreement.</p>
<p>D.  Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of England and Wales, without respect to or application of its conflicts-of-laws provisions.   If there are any disputes or conflicts related to or arising out of this Agreement, You and BANGO shall use reasonable means to resolve the conflict prior to starting any lawsuits or other litigation, including negotiation between management personnel capable of resolving the conflicts. However, in the event either You or BANGO should start any litigation arising out of this Agreement, You expressly agree that the litigation will take place exclusively in the courts located in London, England, and You expressly agree that any such court has personal jurisdiction over You. You waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.  Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.</p>
<p>E.  Waiver; Severability. No waiver of any provision or breach of this Agreement (a) shall be effective unless made in writing, or (b) shall operate as or be construed to be a continuing waiver of such provision or breach.
