.. _addon_statuses:

Add-on Statuses
===============

* There are 5 possible values for the ``status`` property of an add-on: *public*, *pending*, *rejected*, *incomplete* or *blocked*.
* There are 4 possible values for the ``status`` property on an add-on version: *public*, *obsolete*, *pending*, *rejected*.

Add-on ``status`` directly depend on the ``status`` of its versions:

* Add-ons that are *blocked* never change.
* Add-ons with at least one *public* version are *public*.
* Add-ons with no *public* version and at least one *pending* version are *pending*.
* Add-ons with no *public* or *pending* version, and at least one *rejected* version are *rejected*.
* Add-ons with no *public*, *pending* or *rejected* version are *incomplete*.

Blocked Add-ons are hidden from the public. Reviewers and developers may still
access them, but can not make any modifications to them, only admins can.

In addition, Add-ons also have a ``disabled`` property that can be set to
``true`` by the developer to disable the add-on. Disabled add-ons are hidden
from the public and do not appear in the reviewers queue, but retain their
original status so they can be re-enabled by just switching ``disabled`` back
to ``false``.


Add-on and Add-on Version Submission
====================================

Submitting an Add-on or an Add-on Version is done in two steps. The client must
be logged in for all these steps and the user submitting the add-on or the
add-on version must have accepted the terms of use.

1. :ref:`Validate your package <addon_validation-post-label>`. The validation
   will return a validation id.
2. :ref:`Post your add-on <addon-post-label>` or
   :ref:`your add-on version <addon-version-post-label>` using the validation
   id obtained during the previous step. This will create an add-on or an
   add-on version and populate the data with the contents of the manifest.

.. _addon_validation:

Validation
----------

.. note:: The validation API does not require you to be authenticated, however
    you cannot create add-ons from those unauthenticated validations.
    To validate and then submit an add-on you must be authenticated with the
    same account for both steps.

.. _addon_validation-post-label:

.. http:post:: /api/v2/extensions/validation/

    Validate your add-on. The zip file containting your add-on should be sent
    as the POST body directly.
    A :ref:`validation result <addon_validation-response-label>` is returned.

    :reqheader Content-Type: *must* to be set to ``application/zip``
    :reqheader Content-Disposition: *must* be set to ``form-data; name="binary_data"; filename="extension.zip"``

    :status 201: successfully created, processed.
    :status 202: successfully created, still processing.
    :status 400: some errors were found in your add-on.

.. _addon_validation-response-label:

.. http:get:: /api/v2/extensions/validation/(string:id)/

    **Response**

    A single validation result. You should poll this API until it returns
    a result with the ``processed`` property set to ``true`` before moving on
    with the submission process.

    :resjson string id: the id of the validation.
    :resjson boolean processed: if the validation has been processed.
    :resjson boolean valid: if the validation passed.
    :resjson string validation: the resulting validation messages if it failed.
    :type validation: string

    :status 200: successfully completed.
    :status 404: validation not found.

.. _addon_creation:

Add-on Creation
---------------

.. _addon-post-label:

.. http:post:: /api/v2/extensions/extension/

    .. note:: Requires authentication and a successful validation result.

    Create an add-on. Note that an add-on version is created automatically for
    you.
    An :ref:`add-on <addon-detail>` is returned. Icons are processed
    asynchronously; as a result, the json data returned might not contain the
    final URL for the icons at this time.

    :reqjson string validation_id: the id of the
        :ref:`validation result <addon_validation>` for your add-on.
    :reqjson string message (optional): Notes for reviewers about the
                                        submission.

    :status 201: successfully created.
    :status 400: some errors were found in your add-on.

Add-on Version Creation
-----------------------

.. _addon-version-post-label:


.. http:post:: /api/v2/extensions/extension/(int:id)|(string:slug)/versions/

    .. note::
        Requires authentication, ownership of the add-on (which must not be in
        ``disabled`` state) and a successful validation result.

    Create an add-on version.

    :reqjson string validation_id: the id of the
        :ref:`validation result <addon_validation>` for your add-on version.
    :reqjson string message (optional): Notes for reviewers about the
                                        submission.

    :param int id: The add-on id
    :param string slug: The add-on slug

    :status 201: successfully created.
    :status 400: some errors were found in your add-on.
    :status 403: not allowed.
    :status 404: add-on not found.



Add-ons Review Queue
====================

Any add-on that is not disabled by its developer, and has at least one
*pending* version is shown in the review queue, even if the add-on itself is
currently public.

Add-ons are not directly published or rejected, Add-ons Versions are. Usually
the add-on ``latest_version`` is the version that needs to be reviewed.

Once a version is published, rejected or deleted, the parent Add-on ``status``
:ref:`can change as described above<addon_statuses>`.
