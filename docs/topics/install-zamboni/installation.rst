==================
Installing Zamboni
==================

We're going to use all the hottest tools to set up a nice environment.  Skip
steps at your own peril. Here we go!

issues, or compliments.


.. _ubuntu-packages:

1. Installing dependencies
--------------------------

On OS X
~~~~~~~
The best solution for installing UNIX tools on OS X is Homebrew_.

The following packages will get you set for zamboni::

    brew install python libxml2 mysql openssl swig304 jpeg pngcrush redis

On Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~
The following command will install the required development files on Ubuntu or,
if you're running a recent version, you can `install them automatically
<apt:python-dev,python-virtualenv,libxml2-dev,libxslt1-dev,libmysqlclient-dev,libmemcached-dev,libssl-dev,swig openssl,curl,pngcrush,redis-server>`_::

    sudo aptitude install python-dev python-virtualenv libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libmysqlclient-dev libssl-dev swig openssl curl pngcrush redis-server

Services
~~~~~~~~
Zamboni has three dependencies you must install and have running:

* MySQL should require no configuration.
* Redis should require no configuration.
* Seee :ref:`elasticsearch <Elasticsearch>` for setup and configuration.

2. Grab the source
------------------

Grab zamboni from github with::

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/mozilla/zamboni.git
    cd zamboni

``zamboni.git`` is all the source code.  :ref:`updating` is detailed later on.

If at any point you realize you forgot to clone with the recursive
flag, you can fix that by running::

    git submodule update --init --recursive


3. Setup a virtualenv
---------------------

`virtualenv`_ is a tool to create
isolated Python environments. This will let you put all of Zamboni's
dependencies in a single directory rather than your global Python directory.
For ultimate convenience, we'll also use `virtualenvwrapper`_
which adds commands to your shell.

Since each shell setup is different, you can install everything you need
and configure your shell using the `virtualenv-burrito`_. Type this::

    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito/master/virtualenv-burrito.sh | $SHELL

Open a new shell to test it out. You should have the ``workon`` and
``mkvirtualenv`` commands.

.. _Homebrew: http://brew.sh/
.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _`virtualenv-burrito`: https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito
.. _virtualenvwrapper: http://www.doughellmann.com/docs/virtualenvwrapper/

4. Getting Packages
-------------------

Now we're ready to go, so create an environment for zamboni::

    mkvirtualenv zamboni

That creates a clean environment named zamboni using Python 2.7. You can get
out of the environment by restarting your shell or calling ``deactivate``.

To get back into the zamboni environment later, type::

    workon zamboni  # requires virtualenvwrapper

.. note:: Zamboni requires at least Python 2.7.0, production is using
          Python 2.7.5.

.. note:: If you want to use a different Python binary, pass the name (if it is
          on your path) or the full path to mkvirtualenv with ``--python``::

            mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7 zamboni

.. note:: If you are using an older version of virtualenv that defaults to
          using system packages you might need to pass ``--no-site-packages``::

            mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages zamboni

First make sure you have a recent `pip`_ for security reasons.
From inside your activated virtualenv, install the required python packages::

    make update_deps

Issues at this point? See :doc:`./troubleshooting`.

5. Settings
-----------

Most of zamboni is already configured in ``mkt.settings.py``, but there's one thing
you'll need to configure locally, the database. The easiest way to do that
is by setting an environment variable (see next section).

Optionally you can create a local settings file and place anything custom
into ``settings_local.py``.

Any file that looks like ``settings_local*`` is for local use only; it will be
ignored by git.

Environment settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Out of the box, zamboni should work without any need for settings changes.
Some settings are configurable from the environment. See the
`marketplace docs`_ for information on the environment variables and how
they affect zamboni.

6. Setting up a Mysql Database
------------------------------

Django provides commands to create the database and tables needed, and load essential data::

    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py loaddata init

Database Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each incremental change we add to the database is done with Django migrations.
To keep your local DB fresh and up to date, run migrations like this::

    ./manage.py migrate

Loading Test Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fake apps and feed collections can be created by running::

    ./manage.py generate_feed

Specific example applications can be loaded by running::

    ./manage.py generate_apps_from_spec data/apps/test_apps.json

See :doc:`/topics/fake-app-spec` for details of the JSON format.

If you just want a certain number of public apps in various categories to be
created, run::

    ./manage.py generate_apps N

where N is the number of apps you want created in your database.

7. Check it works
-----------------

If you've gotten the system requirements, downloaded ``zamboni``,
set up your virtualenv with the compiled packages, and
configured your settings and database, you're good to go::

    ./manage.py runserver

Hit::

    http://localhost:2600/services/monitor

This will report any errors or issues in your installation.

8. Create an admin user
-----------------------

Chances are that for development, you'll want an admin account.

After logging in, run this management command::

    ./manage.py addusertogroup <your email> 1

9. Setting up the pages
-----------------------

To set up the assets for the developer hub, reviewer tools, or admin pages::

    npm install
    python manage.py compress_assets

For local development, it would also be good to set::

    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True


Post installation
-----------------

To keep your zamboni up to date with the latest changes in source files,
requrirements and database migrations run::

    make full_update

Advanced Installation
---------------------

In production we use things like memcached, rabbitmq + celery and Stylus.
Learn more about installing these on the :doc:`./advanced-installation` page.

.. note::

    Although we make an effort to keep advanced items as optional installs
    you might need to install some components in order to run tests or start
    up the development server.
